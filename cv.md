### Summary
 I'm 35 year old and now work as a mobile device repairer. Unfortunately, this way has no prospects and I choose programming like my next work way. I have 2 year expirence as a Siemens PLC-programer. And now Full Stack development is interesting for me.
 
### Hard Skills
 HTML5, CSS/BEM, Figma, Javascript ES6, Python, MySQL, SQLite, Git, Algorithms and Data Structures, OOP, PLC Programming Languages (LAD)

### Code example
This is an example from Codewars. Task text:
*Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function. For example, 9 is a single digit, 66 has 2 digits and 128685 has 6 digits. Be careful to avoid overflows/underflows.*
...and my solution was:
```
const digits = (n) => {
  return n.toString().length;
}
```
